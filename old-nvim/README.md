# Old Neovim Configuration
---
**Disclaimer**: This Neovim configuration is my initial attempt at configuring
Neovim using Lua.  I blindly copied it from ThePrimegen video and, while it
at least works, I strongly advise against using it in its current state.  The
configuration relies on Packer, which is unmaintained.  The purpose of this
dir is mainly for historical reference, and it is not recommended for use in a
production environment.
